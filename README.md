# E-commerce Sales Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis on an e-commerce dataset to gain insights into sales trends and profitability. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and identification of key factors influencing sales performance.

## Overview

The notebook `e-commerce-1.ipynb` contains the Python code for this analysis. It uses libraries such as Pandas, Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

## Key Steps

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Reads the CSV file, handles encoding issues, and preprocesses the data.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    *   Examines sales trends by month, category, and sub-category.
    *   Analyzes profit margins across different segments.
    *   Visualizes key relationships using Plotly.
3.  **Visualizations**: Creates interactive charts to display sales and profit distributions.

## Libraries Used

*   `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
*   `plotly.express`: High-level interface for creating figures.
*   `plotly.graph_objects`: For creating and customizing advanced plots.
*   `plotly.io`: For graph template customization.
*   `plotly.colors`: For color scales in visualizations.

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

    ```
    pip install pandas plotly
    ```
2.  Download the notebook (`e-commerce-1.ipynb`) and the dataset (`Sample - Superstore.csv`).
3.  Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `Sample - Superstore.csv`, which contains sales data for an e-commerce store.
